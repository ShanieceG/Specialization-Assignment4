The remaining charts show the total population for each population class in each type of place/area.
There are no Census Designated Places and towns with a population greater than or equal to 500,000. 
There are no villages with a population greater than or equal to 100,000.
There are no unknown areas with a population less than 250.
All municipalities have a population of 10,000-49,999 or 250,000-499,999. The total of all muncipalities with a population of 250,000-499,999 is under 300,000. Thus there is only 1 municipality with a population of 250,000-499,999.
All areas classified as a city & borough have a population between 1,000-49,999.

A problem that I ran into was the charts not showing all population classes. It only showed the population classes that had data. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but I would have liked to shown the empty classes easily within the charts. I also would have liked to developed a function that would filter and print the chart for the specific area/place without having to manually filter the data and print each graph. I haven't had much experience with writing custom functions so hopefully that is something that I can develop later on.
