Figure 1 shows the total population for each population class spilt by the type of area/place. Given the large population for cities and Census Designated Places these graphs aren't very helpful for seeing the total population for other areas/places.

Code for Figure 1
 #Plot multiple graphs that show total population for each population class separtated by location class
